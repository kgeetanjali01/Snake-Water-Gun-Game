Snake Water Gun Game in Python
This Python project is a simple text-based game that mimics the popular hand game "Snake, Water, Gun." Similar to the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors," the game has three choices:
- Snake: Wins against Water, loses to Gun.
- Water: Wins against Gun, loses to Snake.
- Gun: Wins against Snake, loses to Water.

Game Logic:
1. The player is prompted to choose one of the three options.
2. The computer randomly selects one as well.
3. The winner is decided based on predefined rules:
   - Snake drinks Water
   - Water douses Gun
   - Gun kills Snake
